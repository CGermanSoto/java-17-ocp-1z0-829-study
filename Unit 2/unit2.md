# Building Blocks

### Objectives covered in this chapter

**Working With Java Primitive Data Types and String APIs**
* Declare and initialize variables (including casting and promoting
primitive data types)

* Identify the scope of variables

* Use local variable type inference

**Describing and Using Objects and Classes**

* Declare and instantiate Java objects, and explain objectsâ€™ lifecycles
(including creation, dereferencing by reassignment, and garbage
collection)

* Read or write to object fields

## Creating objects 
**Object** is an instance of a class.

**CALLING CONSTRUCTORS** 
```java
Park p = new Park();
```
This gives Java a place to store a reference to the
object.
Then you write new Park() to actually create the object.
